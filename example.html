<div class="textblock"><p>Portage provides very crude mesh and state manager frameworks aptly called <code>Simple_Mesh</code> and <code>Simple_State</code>. The goal of these frameworks is to show how one can wrap their favorite mesh and state manager for use with portage - <em>they should not be used in any production sense.</em> </p><hr/>
<h1>The Mesh and State</h1>
<h2>Portage::Simple_Mesh</h2>
<p>This mesh framework is a non-distributed (i.e. has no ghost information), 3D, regular Cartesian mesh framework. A Simple_Mesh is constructed by specifying the extents of the box and the number of cells in each direction. The constructor then builds connectivity information between cell, node, and face indices. The ordering of things like the nodes making up a cell, or the faces making up a cell are specified consistently, but the choice of ordering does not matter. There are a few helper functions like Portage::Simple_Mesh::cell_get_nodes() that will retrieve the indices of some connected mesh entities given another mesh entity's index.</p>
<h2>Portage::Simple_State</h2>
<p>The state manager for Portage::Simple_Mesh is essentially a collection of field data specified by some name (e.g. "density") and location on the Portage::Simple_Mesh where they live (e.g. Portage::CELL). The constructor for a Portage::Simple_State takes a pointer to a Portage::Simple_Mesh so that it has access to things like the number of nodes in the mesh. Data are added to and retrieved from the state manager via <code>add</code> and <code>get</code> methods. Iterators are provided for the map between <code>(name, location)</code> pairs and the data.</p>
<h1>Wrappers</h1>
<p>As mentioned on the <a class="el" href="concepts.html">Concepts</a> page, the search, intersect, and interpolate actions in portage all operate on mesh/particle and state <em>wrappers</em>. The reason for this is that these three steps may need to ask for some information that may not be readily available within the original mesh/particle and state frameworks, but could be constructed within a wrapper.</p>
<p>We provide a helper class, Portage::AuxMeshTopology, that assists in extending a basic mesh's topological entities needed for some remap capabilities. One does not <em>need</em> to use the AuxMeshTopology class, especially if one's mesh already efficiently supports the advanced mesh topologies.</p>
<p>In particular, the advanced mesh topologies and entities, which we term <em>sides</em>, <em>corners</em>, and <em>wedges</em> are utilized in node-centered remapping, but are also <em>required</em> if there are cells with non-planar faces in the remap. In 2d, a side is triangle composed of the cell center and the two nodes of an edge; a wedge is a triangle composed of half of a side, by the cell center and the edge's midpoint and one of its nodes; a corner is a quadrilateral formed by the two wedges in a cell attached to a node. In 3d, the idea is extended such that a side is a tetrahedron composed of the cell center, the two nodes of an edge, and the face center of a face attached to that edge; wedges are again half of a side, but this time a tetrahedron composed of the cell center, an edge's midpoint and one of its nodes, and the face center; a corner is the collection of all wedges in a cell attached to a node.</p>
<h2>Portage::AuxMeshTopology</h2>
<p>This helper class will build the additional mesh entities and connectivities from a basic mesh framework wrapper. The basic mesh framework wrapper must support cells, nodes, and faces as well as connectivity and number queries about these entities.</p>
<p>This class is not a complete class design. In particular, it is designed to be used within the <a href="https://en.m.mwikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern">Curiously Recurring Template Pattern</a>(CRTP) design pattern to achieve static polymorphism. Under the CRTP in this case, the basic mesh framework wrapper looks something like</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">class </span>Basic_Mesh_Wrapper : <span class="keyword">public</span> AuxMeshTopology&lt;Basic_Mesh_Wrapper&gt; {...};</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>In this way, the <code>Basic_Mesh_Wrapper</code> can use its own methods, or defer to AuxMeshTopology to perform more advanced queries.</p>
<p>In addition to the advanced mesh entities (sides, wedges, and corners), AuxMeshTopology also resolves some advanced connectivity information. An example is Portage::AuxMeshTopology::node_get_cell_adj_nodes(), which, given a node index in the mesh, returns a vector of all the nodes that are attached to all cells attached to the given node. AuxMeshTopology additionally creates iterators over all the various types of mesh entities, provides geometric information (e.g. volumes, centroids, etc.) of the mesh entities, and a method to determine if an entitiy is on the domain boundary (needed for limiting in higher-order remaps).</p>
<p><em>If one does <b>not</b> use AuxMeshTopology to help extend their mesh wrapper's functionality, one should ensure that their mesh wrapper at least has the same public functions as AuxMeshTopology.</em> For this reason, it is advised to utilize AuxMeshTopology where possible, but to defer to one's own mesh framework wrapper when more efficient methods are available.</p>
<h2>Portage::Simple_Mesh_Wrapper</h2>
<p>This wraps the Portage::Simple_Mesh framework. Simple_Mesh, as its name suggests, is quite simple and does not know about advanced mesh entities nor connectivities. It lets AuxMeshTopology do the vast majority of the heavy lifting by automatically creating the advanced mesh features.</p>
<p>Where possible, Simple_Mesh_Wrapper provides quick and efficient answers to queries that AuxMeshTopology would otherwise solve in a general sense. Two trivial examples are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Portage::Simple_Mesh_Wrapper::cell_get_type(), which determines the Portage::Entity_type (e.g. PARALLEL_OWNED, PARALLEL_GHOST, etc.). We know Portage::Simple_Mesh does not know anything about ghost information, so we simple return Portage::Entity_type::PARALLEL_OWNED.</li>
<li>Portage::Simple_Mesh_Wrapper::cell_get_element_type(), which determines the geometric shape of a given cell from one of the Portage::Element_type's. Simple mesh is only a 3d, structured Cartesian mesh, so we always return Portage::Element_type::HEX.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few other examples within Portage::Simple_Mesh_Wrapper where the AuxMeshTopology methods are overwritten to take advantage of information that is cached within the Portage::Simple_Mesh. This is a prime example of how the CRTP and AuxMeshTopology are intended to be used. In fact, even our wrapper (wonton::flecsi_mesh_t) to the sophisticated Burton mesh <a href="https://github.com/laristra/flecsi-sp">specialization</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/laristra/flecsi">FleCSI</a> mesh framework uses AuxMeshTopology to answer some queries.</p>
<h2>Portage::Simple_State_Wrapper</h2>
<p>There is no equivalent of AuxMeshTopology for state wrappers. This is simply because the requirements of a state manager are much less intense than those of the mesh framework. In particular, the state wrappers only need to know how to add data, get data, and query things like the size of the data and where the data lives (Portage::CELL or Portage::NODE). Portage::Simple_State_Wrapper exposes this functionality and provides some error checking for missing or duplicate data in the underlying Portage::Simple_State object.</p>
<h1>Applications and Tests</h1>
<p>Nearly all of the generic unit tests have been designed to work with the Portage::Simple_Mesh_Wrapper and Portage::Simple_State_Wrapper data structures when a full up mesh is required. These should serve as examples of the types of things one may want to do with a mesh and state framework.</p>
<p>Better examples of how to use these wrappers to actually do a remap of field data are in the application tests. In particular, the <code>app/simple_mesh_app/simple_mesh_app.cc</code> program shows how to wrap mesh and state objects, adds some field data to the source state, and utilize Portage::Driver with various search, intersect, and interpolate algorithms to perform the remap. The Portage::Driver is templated on mesh wrapper type and state wrapper type, and can be used with other frameworks. It need not be used at all, but is a nice starting point for writing one's own remap application. </p>
